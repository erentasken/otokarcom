# Socket Communication System

## Overview

This project implements a socket communication system in C# that simulates device interactions using multicast and broadcast messaging. It establishes a TCP server that listens for connections on a specified IP address and port. The application can send mock messages to simulate device activity and display connected devices.

## Key Features

- **Socket Communication**: Manages connections and message exchanges between devices.
- **Multicast and Broadcast**: Supports sending messages to specific groups or all connected devices.
- **Device Simulation**: Randomly sends messages from simulated devices to mimic real-world behavior.
